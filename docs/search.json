Marketing research specifies the information required to address these issues, designs the methods for collecting information, manages and implements the data collection process, analyzes the results, and communicates the findings and their implications.” [1]"

    "text": "Differences between Problem Solving Research and Problem Identification Research\nPurpose: The primary purpose of problem identification research is to identify and define marketing problems and opportunities that need to be addressed. The main goal of problem-solving research is to develop and evaluate solutions to marketing problems.\nNature of the problem: Problem identification research is used when the problem or opportunity is not clearly defined or understood. Problem-solving research is used when the problem or opportunity is clearly defined and requires a specific solution.\nResearch methods: Problem identification research typically involves exploratory research methods, such as focus groups, interviews, and surveys, to gather qualitative data and insights about the problem or opportunity. Problem-solving research involves more rigorous and structured research methods, such as experiments and surveys, to test and validate potential solutions.\nOutcome: The outcome of problem identification research is a clear understanding of the problem or opportunity, which may lead to further research or the development of a problem-solving strategy. The outcome of problem-solving research is a specific solution or set of solutions that can be implemented to address the problem or opportunity.\nIn summary, problem identification research is used to identify and define marketing problems and opportunities, while problem-solving research is used to develop and evaluate solutions to those problems and opportunities.
