    "text": "Aug 21, 2023.\n\n\n\nLet us break down the definition of Marketing Research, given by the American Marketing Association (AMA):\n\n“Marketing Research is the function that links the consumer, customer, and public to the marketer through information –\ninformation used to\n\nidentify and define opportunities and problems;\ngenerate, refine, and evaluate actions;\nmonitor performance;\nimprove understanding of it as a process\n\nIt specifies the:\n\ninformation required to address these issues,\ndesigns the method for collecting information,\nmanages and implements the data collection process,\nanalyzes the results\ncommunicates the findings and their implications. (Approved 2017)” [1]\n\n\n\n\nMarketing research, fundamentally pivotal for businesses, primarily falls into two core categories: Problem-Identification and Problem-Solving Research. Their distinct objectives cater to unique facets of market understanding.\n1. Problem-Identification Research: Before a business can act, it needs to understand. This diagnostic branch of research aids businesses in discerning latent or emerging market challenges and prospects. It involves identifying potential market opportunities or pinpointing issues before they become significant challenges. Examples include:\n\nMarket Potential Research: Identifying the potential of a new market or a new segment.\nMarket Share Research: Finding out how much of the market a business has compared to its competitors.\nMarket Characteristic Research: Understanding the dynamics of a market, such as seasonality.\nSales Analysis: Assessing sales performance to determine areas of weakness or strength.\nForecasting: Predicting future sales or market trends based on historical data and other factors.\nImage Studies: Understanding the image of a brand or company in the minds of consumers. [2]\n\n2. Problem-Solving Research: Once a problem or an opportunity is identified, problem-solving research provides ways to address it. This type of research focuses on resolving the identified issues or exploiting the identified opportunities. Examples include:\n\nSegmentation Research: Determining the different segments within a market to target more effectively.\nProduct Research: Evaluating product design, packaging, and product modifications. Also, includes testing new product concepts.\nPricing Research: Determining the optimal price point for a product or service.\nPromotion Research: Evaluating the effectiveness of advertising, sales promotions, and other marketing communications.\nDistribution Research: Figuring out the most effective channels to distribute a product or service.\nPositioning Research: Understanding how a brand or product is perceived in comparison to competitors and finding ways to position it more favorably.\n\n\nIn the realm of marketing research, the distinction between problem-identification and problem-solving research allows businesses to first diagnose their challenges or opportunities and then implement strategies based on concrete data and insights. [2]\n\n\n\n\nMarket Potential Research: Identifying the potential of a new market or a new segment.\n\nIllustration: Before introducing its McVeggie burger in India, McDonald’s gauged the demand for a vegetarian-only menu, catering to a country with a significant vegetarian demographic.\n\nMarket Share Research: Finding out how much of the market a business owns in comparison to its competitors.\n\nIllustration: McDonald’s consistently assesses its market share against rivals like Burger King, KFC, and Subway to comprehend its standing in the global fast-food domain.\n\nMarket Characteristic Research: Recognizing the dynamics of a market, such as seasonality.\n\nIllustration: In regions with pronounced seasonal patterns, McDonald’s introduces particular seasonal menu items, like the Shamrock Shake around St. Patrick’s Day in the U.S.\n\nSales Analysis: Evaluating sales performance to pinpoint areas of weakness or strength.\n\nIllustration: After rolling out the all-day breakfast menu, McDonald’s analyzed sales to determine which items sold best and the peak times for their popularity.\n\nForecasting: Predicting future sales or market trends based on past data and various factors.\n\nIllustration: Observing the uptick in health consciousness among consumers, McDonald’s anticipated a surge in demand for healthier menu choices, leading to the addition of salads, fruit options, and lean meat selections.\n\nImage Studies: Grasping the image of a brand or company as perceived by consumers.\n\nIllustration: McDonald’s often undertakes brand perception studies. Identifying a gap in how consumers viewed their food quality, they initiated a transparency campaign to address misconceptions about their ingredients and sourcing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSegmentation Research: Discerning distinct segments within a market to hone targeting.\n\nIllustration: McDonald’s recognized a growing segment of health-conscious consumers, leading to the introduction of their “Favorites Under 400 Calories” menu in certain markets.\n\nProduct Research: Reviewing product design, packaging, and modifications. This encompasses testing of new product ideas.\n\nIllustration: Before the global launch of the McPlant, a plant-based burger, McDonald’s tested its taste, texture, and consumer reception in select locations.\n\nPricing Research: Pinpointing the optimal price point for an offering.\n\nIllustration: McDonald’s uses various pricing strategies depending on the region. In some areas, they’ve introduced a value menu or tiered pricing to cater to varying customer spending capacities.\n\nPromotion Research: Measuring the efficacy of advertising, sales promotions, and other marketing communications.\n\nIllustration: McDonald’s regularly reviews the performance of its promotional campaigns. For instance, they gauge the impact and reach of their annual Monopoly promotion to determine its return on investment.\n\nDistribution Research: Identifying the most potent channels to distribute a product or service.\n\nIllustration: McDonald’s continually optimizes its distribution strategy. They’ve experimented with formats beyond traditional restaurants, such as McDrive for drive-throughs or McCafé counters in urban areas.\n\nPositioning Research: Grasping how a product or brand is perceived vis-à-vis competitors and strategizing its favorable positioning.\n\nIllustration: McDonald’s emphasizes its position as a family-friendly fast-food destination. Through positioning research, they realized the need to promote their commitment to quality ingredients, leading to the “Our Food, Your Questions” campaign to address consumer concerns transparently.\n\n\nThese illustrations provide a snapshot of how McDonald’s may employ problem-solving research in their marketing strategy. The brand’s global presence offers a myriad of examples spanning these research areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose: The primary purpose of problem identification research is to identify and define marketing problems and opportunities that need to be addressed. The main goal of problem-solving research is to develop and evaluate solutions to marketing problems.\nNature of the problem: Problem identification research is used when the problem or opportunity is not clearly defined or understood. Problem-solving research is used when the problem or opportunity is clearly defined and requires a specific solution.\nResearch methods: Problem identification research typically involves exploratory research methods, such as focus groups, interviews, and surveys, to gather qualitative data and insights about the problem or opportunity. Problem-solving research involves more rigorous and structured research methods, such as experiments and surveys, to test and validate potential solutions.\nOutcome: The outcome of problem identification research is a clear understanding of the problem or opportunity, which may lead to further research or the development of a problem-solving strategy. The outcome of problem-solving research is a specific solution or set of solutions that can be implemented to address the problem or opportunity.\n\nContrast:\n\nProblem identification research is used to identify and define marketing problems and opportunities, while\nProblem-solving research is used to develop and evaluate solutions to those problems and opportunities. [2]\n\n\n\n\nThe Marketing Research Process is a six-step framework used by marketers to gather, analyze, and interpret data for decision-making.\n(i) Step 1: Problem Definition: At this foundational stage, the researcher identifies and articulates the core issue or opportunity. It’s not just about spotting a problem; it’s about understanding its nature, scope, and implications. This step is crucial because a well-defined problem often points toward its solution.\n(ii) Step 2: Development of an Approach to the Problem: After understanding the problem’s essence, the researcher contemplates the contextual factors and develops a tailored approach. This might involve preliminary data collection or drawing from theoretical frameworks to shape the research direction.\n(iii) Step 3: Research Design Formulation: This step involves charting out the blueprint for conducting the research. Decisions regarding whether the research will be exploratory, descriptive, or causal are made. Furthermore, the researcher defines the information sources, research instruments, sampling methodology, and timeline.\n(iv) Step 4: Fieldwork or Data Collection: This phase is where the actual gathering of data occurs. It requires meticulous planning and execution to ensure that the collected data is both reliable and valid. Depending on the research design, methods might include surveys, observations, experiments, or interviews.\n(v) Step 5: Data Preparation and Analysis: Once data is collected, it’s organized, cleaned, and then analyzed. Using various statistical techniques, raw data is transformed into meaningful insights. This step is essential for drawing valid conclusions from the data.\n(vi) Step 6: Report Preparation and Presentation: The findings are compiled into a comprehensive report which is then presented to the stakeholders. This report not only showcases the results but also provides interpretations and recommendations based on the research findings. Effective presentation ensures that the insights are clearly understood and actionable. [2]\n\n\nUsing the Marketing Research Process, let’s critically evaluate McDonald’s approach to addressing a sales decline:\n(i) Step 1: Problem Definition: McDonald’s observed an unanticipated drop in the sales of its iconic Big Mac in certain areas (Smith et al., 2020). Rather than making immediate amendments, they opted to probe the underlying factors. The question raised was: “Are there evolving consumer behaviors or external challenges affecting the Big Mac’s popularity in this region?”\n(ii) Step 2: Development of an Approach to the Problem: To unpack the issue, McDonald’s embarked on an initial exploration, assessing rival campaigns, consumer feedback on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, and emerging dietary shifts (Jones & Williams, 2021). This process aimed to sift out potential drivers of the observed change.\n(iii) Step 3: Research Design Formulation: Based on the preliminary findings, McDonald’s integrated both qualitative and quantitative research methods. They initiated focus group discussions to capture nuanced perceptions, and then scaled up with a detailed survey, targeting their regular patrons and random walk-ins (Lee, 2022).\n(iv) Step 4: Fieldwork or Data Collection: Structured dialogues were held at strategic locations to gather firsthand consumer sentiments. Post these interactions, a meticulously curated questionnaire was distributed across the target audience through various channels, aspiring to crystallize the root causes behind the sales anomaly (Taylor, 2021).\n(v) Step 5: Data Preparation and Analysis: Upon gathering the data, McDonald’s research team embarked on a two-pronged approach. The qualitative findings from discussions were systematically classified, while survey data were processed using advanced analytical tools. Patterns, underlying correlations, and standout insights were extracted, offering a granular view of the situation (Davis & Thompson, 2022).\n(vi) Step 6: Report Preparation and Presentation: The insights were synthesized into a detailed report, enriched with visual aids like graphs and infographics. The analysis pinpointed an upswing in health-centric eating habits in the region, coupled with aggressive promotions by rivals touting “nutritious” offerings (Martin, 2023). Proposed action steps could encompass the reinvention of the Big Mac, recalibrating marketing narratives, or introducing short-term offers to regain traction. This comprehensive dossier was subsequently tabled before the decision-makers for informed strategizing. [3]"

    "text": "Aug 24, 2023\n\nMarketing research design is the process of developing a plan or framework for conducting market research to address specific research objectives.\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of research design is to develop a plan or strategy for conducting research that will help answer a research question or address a research problem in a rigorous and systematic manner. The research design specifies the procedures, methods, and techniques that will be used to collect and analyze data, as well as the criteria for evaluating the results.\nThe dual goal of research design is to ensure that the research is reliable, valid, and generalizable to the target population. A well-designed research study can provide valuable insights and information that can be used to inform decision-making in a variety of fields, including marketing, psychology, sociology, and medicine. [1]\n\n\n\n\nA good research design is essential for producing accurate and reliable results in a research study. Here are some characteristics of a good research design:\n\nClearly defined research question: A good research design starts with a well-defined research question or hypothesis that is focused and specific.\nAppropriate research method: A good research design uses an appropriate research method that is suitable for the research question and objectives, such as surveys, experiments, case studies, or observational studies.\nAppropriate sampling method: A good research design uses an appropriate sampling method that is representative of the target population and reduces bias, such as random sampling, stratified sampling, or convenience sampling.\nValid and reliable data collection tools: A good research design uses valid and reliable data collection tools, such as questionnaires, interviews, or observation protocols, that are appropriate for the research method and sample.\nEthical considerations: A good research design takes into account ethical considerations, such as obtaining informed consent, protecting participant privacy and confidentiality, and avoiding harm or discomfort to participants.\nAdequate sample size: A good research design uses an adequate sample size that is statistically significant and provides enough power to detect meaningful effects or differences.\nData analysis plan: A good research design includes a data analysis plan that is appropriate for the research method and data collected, such as descriptive statistics, regression analysis, or content analysis.\nTimeliness and feasibility: A good research design is feasible and can be completed within the available time frame and resources, while still producing meaningful and valid results.\n\nAn effective marketing research design helps companies to make informed decisions, develop effective marketing strategies, and stay competitive in the marketplace. [2]\n\n\n\nResearch design can be classified into several types based on various criteria. Here are some common ways to classify research design:\n\n\nResearch design can be classified into three main types based on their purpose:\n\nExploratory research design: used to explore a research problem when there is limited or no prior knowledge or understanding of it.\nDescriptive research design: used to describe or summarize characteristics of a population or phenomenon, such as market trends, customer behavior, or demographic data.\nCausal research design: used to establish cause-and-effect relationships between variables.\n\n\n\n\nResearch design can also be classified based on the time frame of the study:\n\nCross-sectional research design:\n\n\nData is collected at a single point in time.\n\n\nLongitudinal research design:\n\n\nData is collected over an extended period of time, and the same sample is followed up at multiple time points.\n\n\n\n\nResearch design can also be classified based on the data collection method:\n\nQuantitative research design:\n\n\nused to collect structured data using methods such as surveys, experiments, or observational studies.\n\n\nQualitative research design:\n\n\nused to collect non-structured or semi-structured data using methods such as interviews, focus groups, or observations.\n\n\n\n\nResearch design can also be classified based on the data analysis method:\n\nDeductive research design:\n\n\nused to test a specific hypothesis or theory.\n\n\nInductive research design:\n\n\nused to generate new theories or hypotheses from the data collected.\n\nIn summary, research design can be classified based on various criteria, such as purpose, time frame, data collection method, and data analysis method. The choice of research design depends on the research question, the nature of the research problem, and the goals of the research. [3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploratory research design is a type of research design used to explore a research problem when there is limited or no prior knowledge or understanding of it.\nGoal: The goal of exploratory research is to gain insights, generate hypotheses, and create a deeper understanding of the research problem.\nUse: Exploratory research is often used when the research problem is ambiguous, complex, or poorly understood, and a researcher wants to explore different ideas, perspectives, and potential solutions.\nIt is often the first step in the research process and is useful in shaping and refining research questions and hypotheses.\nMethods: Exploratory research can be conducted using various methods, such as literature reviews, case studies, observations, interviews, focus groups, or surveys. The choice of the method depends on the nature of the research problem and the goals of the research.\nExploratory research is generally characterized by its flexibility, creativity, and adaptability.\nIt allows the researcher to collect both qualitative and quantitative data and use multiple sources of information to develop a deeper understanding of the research problem.\nThe findings from exploratory research are often not conclusive, and their main goal is to generate new insights and ideas that can be used in subsequent research or decision-making.\nOverall, exploratory research design is a valuable approach to gain a deeper understanding of a research problem, identify potential research questions and hypotheses, and generate new insights and ideas that can inform future research and decision-making. [4]\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusive research design is a type of research design that is used to provide a final conclusion or answer to a research question or problem.\nThe goal of conclusive research is to test a hypothesis or answer a research question with a high degree of confidence.\nConclusive research is often used when a researcher has a clear understanding of the research problem and wants to test a hypothesis or answer a specific research question.\nIt is typically quantitative in nature and involves the collection of structured data using methods such as surveys, experiments, or observational studies.\nConclusive research design involves a more structured approach to research than exploratory research, and it typically requires a larger sample size to ensure that the findings are representative of the population being studied.\nThe research design and methods used in conclusive research are carefully planned to ensure that the results are reliable, valid, and generalizable to the population.\nConclusive research typically involves statistical analysis of the data collected, and the results are used to draw conclusions about the research question or hypothesis being tested.\nThe findings of conclusive research are often used to make informed business decisions, develop effective marketing strategies, or inform public policy.\nOverall, conclusive research design is a valuable approach to provide a final conclusion or answer to a research question or problem. It is typically quantitative in nature, involves a more structured approach to research, and requires careful planning and analysis to ensure that the results are reliable, valid, and generalizable to the population. [5]\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose: Exploratory research is conducted when the researcher has limited or no knowledge of the topic under study and aims to explore it further. On the other hand, conclusive research is conducted when the researcher has a clear understanding of the research problem and aims to provide a final conclusion or answer to the research question.\nMethodology: Exploratory research is flexible in terms of methodology and allows the researcher to use a variety of methods, such as literature reviews, interviews, focus groups, or surveys. The goal is to gather as much information as possible to develop a hypothesis or research question. Conclusive research, on the other hand, is more structured and typically involves quantitative research methods, such as surveys, experiments, or observational studies.\nSample size: Exploratory research often involves a smaller sample size, and the findings are not meant to be generalizable. Conclusive research, on the other hand, involves a larger sample size and the results are intended to be generalizable to the population.\nAnalysis: Exploratory research aims to generate new insights and ideas, and the analysis is often qualitative or descriptive. Conclusive research, on the other hand, is focused on testing a hypothesis or research question, and the analysis is often quantitative and statistical.\n\nIn summary, exploratory research is used to gain insights and develop hypotheses about a research problem, while conclusive research is used to provide a final answer to the research question. Exploratory research is flexible in terms of methodology and analysis, while conclusive research is more structured and quantitative in nature. [6]\n\n\n\n\nConclusive research design can be classified into two main types: descriptive research and causal research.\n\n\n\nDescriptive research is used to describe or summarize characteristics of a population or phenomenon, such as market trends, customer behavior, or demographic data.\nDescriptive research is used to provide a comprehensive picture of a research problem or issue and can be used to answer research questions related to who, what, when, where, and how.\nDescriptive research design is typically used when the researcher wants to understand the current state of affairs or existing correlations between variables.\nSome common methods used in descriptive research include surveys, observations, and secondary data analysis.\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive research can be sub-classified into two main types based on the time frame of the study: cross-sectional research design and longitudinal research design.\n\n\n\n\nCross-sectional research design is a type of descriptive research design that involves collecting data from a sample of individuals at a single point in time.\nThe purpose of this type of research design is to describe or summarize characteristics of a population or phenomenon at a specific point in time.\nCross-sectional research design is typically used when the researcher wants to examine the prevalence of a particular characteristic, behavior, or attitude within a specific population.\nCommon methods used in cross-sectional research design include surveys, questionnaires, and observational studies. [7]\n\n\n\n\n\nLongitudinal research design is a type of descriptive research design that involves collecting data from a sample of individuals over an extended period of time.\nThe purpose of this type of research design is to describe or summarize changes in a population or phenomenon over time.\nLongitudinal research design can be further classified into three sub-types:\n\n\nTrend studies: Trend studies are used to examine changes in a variable over time. Trend studies involve collecting data at multiple time points, and the purpose is to identify whether a particular variable is increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable over time.\nCohort studies: Cohort studies are used to examine changes in a specific group of individuals over time. Cohort studies involve selecting a sample of individuals who share a common characteristic or experience, such as age, occupation, or exposure to a specific event, and following them over time to track changes in their behavior or health.\nPanel studies: Panel studies are used to examine changes in the same individuals over time. Panel studies involve selecting a sample of individuals and collecting data from them at multiple time points. The purpose is to track changes in the behavior, health, or other characteristics of the same individuals over time. [8]\n\n\n\n\nLongitudinal and cross-sectional research designs have different advantages and disadvantages depending on the research question and the purpose of the study. Here are some of the relative advantages and disadvantages of each design:\nAdvantages of longitudinal research design:\n\nCaptures changes over time: Longitudinal research design enables the researcher to capture changes in variables over time, which is particularly useful for studying the development of a phenomenon or tracking the impact of an intervention.\nGreater control over extraneous variables: Since the same individuals are being studied over time, longitudinal research design enables the researcher to control for extraneous variables that may affect the outcome.\nMore robust findings: Longitudinal research design can provide more robust findings because the same individuals are being studied over time, which reduces the likelihood of sampling bias.\nIt allows researchers to identify factors that predict change over time, and to test hypotheses about causal relationships between variables.\n\nDisadvantages of longitudinal research design:\n\nExpensive and time-consuming: Longitudinal research design can be expensive and time-consuming, as data is collected over an extended period of time and requires tracking the same individuals.\nAttrition: There is a risk of attrition in longitudinal studies, where participants may drop out or become lost to follow-up, which can limit the generalizability of the findings.\nPractice effects: Longitudinal research design can be affected by practice effects, where participants may become more familiar with the research process over time, which may affect their responses.\n\nAdvantages of cross-sectional research design:\n\nQuick and cost-effective: Cross-sectional research design is quick and cost-effective, as data is collected at a single point in time.\nEasy to implement: Cross-sectional research design is easy to implement, and it is suitable for studying a large and diverse population.\nCan provide an overview: Cross-sectional research design provides an overview of a phenomenon or population at a single point in time, which can be useful for identifying patterns and trends.\nIt provides a snapshot of a particular point in time, which can be useful for identifying trends and patterns.\n\nDisadvantages of cross-sectional research design:\n\nCannot capture changes over time: Cross-sectional research design cannot capture changes in variables over time, which limits its usefulness for studying the development of a phenomenon or tracking the impact of an intervention.\nProne to sampling bias: Cross-sectional research design can be prone to sampling bias, as the sample may not be representative of the population of interest.\nCannot control for extraneous variables: Cross-sectional research design cannot control for extraneous variables that may affect the outcome, which limits its usefulness for causal inference. [9]\n\n\n\n\n\nCausal research is used to establish cause-and-effect relationships between variables.\nCausal research is used to determine whether a change in one variable causes a change in another variable, and is typically used when the researcher wants to understand the underlying mechanisms of a phenomenon.\nCausal research design typically involves experimental designs, where the researcher manipulates one variable (independent variable) and observes the effect on another variable (dependent variable), while controlling for extraneous variables.\nCausal research is typically more rigorous and time-consuming than descriptive research, but it can provide more definitive answers to research questions.\n\nCausal research typically involves the following steps:\n\nIdentifying the research problem and formulating a research question or hypothesis.\nReviewing the literature to identify relevant theories, concepts, and previous research.\nIdentifying the variables of interest and defining them operationally.\nDesigning the study, including selecting the research method, participants, and measures.\nConducting the study, including collecting and analyzing data.\nInterpreting the results, including determining whether there is a causal relationship between the variables.\n\nSub-classification of Causal Research\n\nExplanatory Research: This type of research is used to explain the causal relationship between variables. Explanatory research typically involves conducting experiments or quasi-experiments in which the researcher manipulates one variable to determine its effect on another variable, while controlling for extraneous variables that may affect the results. Explanatory research is often used in fields such as psychology, sociology, and economics to determine the causes of behavior, social phenomena, and economic trends, respectively.\nPredictive Research: This type of research is used to predict the effect of a variable on another variable. Predictive research typically involves analyzing data from past events to identify patterns and relationships between variables. Predictive research is often used in fields such as marketing, finance, and epidemiology to forecast consumer behavior, stock prices, and disease outbreaks, respectively.\nPrescriptive Research: This type of research is used to identify the best course of action to achieve a desired outcome. Prescriptive research typically involves analyzing data from past events to identify the most effective interventions or treatments for a particular problem. Prescriptive research is often used in fields such as medicine, education, and public policy to identify the most effective treatments for diseases, teaching methods, and policy interventions, respectively.\n\nCausal research can be conducted using a variety of research methods, including experiments, quasi-experiments, and longitudinal studies. In experiments, researchers manipulate one or more variables to determine their effect on another variable, while controlling for extraneous variables that may affect the results. Quasi-experiments involve manipulating a variable that cannot be randomly assigned, such as gender or age. Longitudinal studies involve collecting data over a period of time to determine whether changes in one variable are related to changes in another variable. [10]"
